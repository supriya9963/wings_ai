What are LLMs?

They are advanced AI models trained on vast amounts of text data to understand and generate human-like language. These models can perform tasks such as:

->Answering questions

->Writing essays, stories, or code

->Translating languages

->Summarizing texts

->Chatting conversationally (like me!)

How do LLMs work?

They are built using deep learning, usually with architectures called Transformers.

They learn patterns, grammar, facts, and reasoning from huge datasets containing books, articles, websites, and more.

After training, they can predict the next word or phrase given some input, allowing them to generate coherent text.
