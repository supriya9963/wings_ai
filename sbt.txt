-- What is SBT?

->SBT (Simple Build Tool / Scala Build Tool) is the official build tool for Scala projects, also supports Java.

->Similar to Maven or Gradle (used in Java), but designed with Scala’s flexibility in mind.

->Helps automate tasks like compiling code, running tests, packaging, dependency management, and deployment.

--- Key Features of SBT

1.Incremental Compilation

->Only recompiles the changed files instead of rebuilding everything.

->Makes builds faster.

2.Dependency Management

->Uses Ivy or Maven repositories to fetch external libraries.

->You just declare dependencies in build.sbt, SBT downloads them automatically.

-3.Multi-Project Builds

->You can manage multiple sub-projects in one build.

->Useful for large applications with modular design.

4.Interactive Shell

->You can run sbt in the terminal to get an interactive shell.

->Commands like compile, run, test, clean are executed inside this shell.

5.Cross-Building

->Can build for multiple versions of Scala at the same time.

6.Customization

->You can define custom tasks and plugins in build.sbt.

---- Common SBT Commands

->sbt compile → Compiles the source code.

->sbt run → Runs the main application.

->sbt test → Runs tests.

->sbt clean → Cleans compiled files.

->sbt package → Creates a JAR file of your project.
