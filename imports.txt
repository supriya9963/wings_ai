ðŸ”¹ JSON

What it is:

JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is a lightweight, text-based data format used to represent structured data.

Itâ€™s language-independent but widely supported across programming languages.

Uses:

Exchanging data between client and server (APIs).

Configuration files (package.json, tsconfig.json).

Lightweight storage for logs or app state.

Cross-platform data sharing.

ðŸ”¹ Wreq (Haskell Library)

What it is:

Wreq is a Haskell HTTP client library for making web requests easily.

Built on top of lower-level libraries, but provides a simpler interface.

Uses:

Making HTTP requests (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE).

Consuming JSON APIs (often with the aeson library).

Automating web-based tasks (e.g., posting data, fetching updates).

Handling cookies, redirects, authentication.

Web scraping.

ðŸ”¹ Other Common Imports
âœ… requests (Python)

What it is: A Python library for making HTTP requests.
Uses: Calling APIs, downloading web pages, sending form data.

âœ… numpy (Python)

What it is: A numerical computing library for Python.
Uses: Math, linear algebra, scientific calculations, working with arrays.

âœ… pandas (Python)

What it is: A Python data analysis library.
Uses: Handling tabular data (like Excel), data cleaning, analysis, and manipulation.

âœ… os / sys (Python)

What it is: Built-in system libraries.
Uses: File management, environment variables, system control.

âœ… aeson (Haskell)

What it is: A Haskell library for JSON parsing and encoding.
Uses: Encode/decode JSON when working with APIs or configs.


ðŸ”¹ HTTP

What it is:

HTTP = HyperText Transfer Protocol.

It is the foundation of communication on the World Wide Web.

It defines how messages are formatted and transmitted between a client (like a browser or app) and a server (like a website or API).

Examples:

When you visit https://example.com, your browser sends an HTTP request to the server.

The server responds with an HTTP response containing the webpage content.

Key Features:

Stateless â†’ Each request is independent, no memory of past requests.

Works with methods like:

GET â†’ Retrieve data

POST â†’ Send data

PUT â†’ Update data

DELETE â†’ Remove data

ðŸ”¹ HTTP Client

What it is:

An HTTP client is a software/tool/library that sends HTTP requests and receives HTTP responses from a server.

Examples:

Web Browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari) â†’ act as HTTP clients.

Code Libraries (requests in Python, Wreq in Haskell, axios in JavaScript) â†’ used in apps to call APIs.

Uses:

Accessing APIs (e.g., weather API, payment API).

Downloading web pages.

Sending form data (login forms, registrations).

Automation (bots, scripts).

ðŸ‘‰ In short:

HTTP = the communication protocol (rules).

HTTP Client = the tool/program that uses HTTP to talk to servers.
