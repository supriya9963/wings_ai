ðŸ”¹ What is an API?

API stands for Application Programming Interface.

Itâ€™s like a messenger that allows two different software applications to talk to each other.

Defines rules and methods for how one program can request data or services from another.

ðŸ”¹ Example (Simple)

Imagine a restaurant:

You = the user.

Menu = the API (list of available requests).

Waiter = the API itself (delivers your request to the kitchen and brings back the food).

Kitchen = the system that processes the request.

So, instead of directly entering the kitchen (system internals), you use the API to get what you need.

ðŸ”¹ Types of APIs

Web APIs â€“ Used to exchange data over the internet (REST, GraphQL, SOAP).

Library APIs â€“ Functions inside programming libraries.

OS APIs â€“ Provided by operating systems (e.g., Windows API, Android API).

Hardware APIs â€“ Let software talk to hardware (like camera or printer APIs).

ðŸ”¹ Real-Life Examples

Google Maps API â†’ lets apps show maps and directions.

Payment APIs (Stripe, PayPal) â†’ handle online payments.

Twitter API â†’ lets developers fetch tweets or post automatically.

OpenAI API â†’ lets apps connect with GPT models (like ChatGPT).

ðŸ‘‰ In one line:
An API is a set of rules that allows one software system to interact with another in a safe and structured way.
